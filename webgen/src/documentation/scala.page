Slang(Scala) allows you to deploy Scala source files directly on link:http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-karaf.html[Apache Felix Karaf]

== Installing Slang(Scala) on Karaf

Before you can get started with Slang's Scala support

=== Requirements

* Apache Felix Karaf 1.2.0

=== Build

The best way to get the Scala support for Slang is currently by link:/source.html[getting the source code] and link:/building.html[building it]

=== Install on Karaf

Install the slang-scala feature on Karaf by running these commands from the Karaf console:

----
features:addUrl mvn:org.fusesource.slang/features/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
features:install slang-scala
----

You can verify that the feature was installed correctly by running the osgi:list command

----
karaf@root> osgi:list
START LEVEL 100
   ID   State         Blueprint      Level  Name
...
[  31] [Active     ] [Created     ] [   20] Apache Geronimo Blueprint Bundle (1.0.0)
[  32] [Active     ] [            ] [   60] scala-library (2.7.7)
[  33] [Active     ] [            ] [   60] scala-compiler (2.7.7)
----

== Deploy your first Scala file

[[CreateScalaFile]]
=== Create the Scala file

Now you're ready to deploy your first Scala file.  In the Karaf deploy folder, create a file name hello.scala

----
package org.fusesource.slang.scala.example {

class HelloWorld {
  // this class doesn't do anything yet
  // just making sure deployment works fine
}

}
----

The source file will automatically get compiled, transformed into an OSGi bundled and deployed.

[[VerifyDeployment]]
=== Verify the deployment

To make sure everything went OK, run osgi:list again:

----
karaf@root> osgi:list
START LEVEL 100
   ID   State         Blueprint      Level  Name
...
[  35] [Active     ] [            ] [   60] some_name (0)
----

Now that you know the bundle id of the deployed scala file, you can also take a closer look at the OSGi bundle headers.
You'll notice the bundle exports the org.fusesource.slang.scala.example package we defined in the source file.

----
karaf@root> osgi:headers 35
...
Export-Package = org.fusesource.slang.scala.example;uses:=scala
----
